## Random Password Generator

#### Description
This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The pre-determined user criteria are character length,
upper, lower case characters, numbers and special characters like !"#$%&'()*+,-./\:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~ and spaces.
The character count must also be between 8-128.

This app uses the native browser to display the password.

The focus point of this application is the use of Javascript (var, alert pop up, confirm pop-ups, if/else statements etc.)
Additionally, twitter bootstrap and custom css were used to provide the user interface and responsiveness of the application.

#### Steps to use:
1. Choose from the character type options provided. You must select at least one checkbox.
2. Use the slider tool to the length of your password. Min character length is eight.
3. Click the "Generate" button
4. Confirm if you are happy with your selection or not.
5. If Yes -  a random password will be generated for you in the display box.
6. If No - your session will be reset.

##### Copy your password
1. Once you have generated a password, it can be copied via the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
